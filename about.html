<div class="editable"><p>Greenham Common Stories is a gathering place for the historical stories, personal memories and media relating to the history of Greenham Common and the Greenham: 100 Years of War and Peace project</p><p><strong><a href="/Update (4 Aug)  GREENHAM PARTICIPANTS AND PRODUCTION TIMELINE version 4.docx">Download the programme</a></strong></p><p>Greenham: 100 Years of &nbsp;War and Peace was a large scale outdoor event celebrating 20 years of the Greenham Trust. On the evenings of the 8th and 9th September 2017 the story of Greenham Common came alive through an amazing spectacle of performance, songs, light projections and live art. Alongside the outdoor event were a series of talks and indoor events about the history of Greenham Common. Fete Day worked in partnership with Rosa Productions and the BBC to gather stories relating to the history of war and peace on the Common.</p><p>The programme of events marked the 20th anniversary of the Greenham &nbsp;Trust which has distributed over &pound;35 million to local good causes since 1997. A FREE outdoor show with talks, walks and exhibitions ran from Sunday the 3rd September to Saturday 9th September 2017. The extraordinary history of Greenham Common formed the basis of a large-scale community theatrical event and show, performed on the runway of the former RAF USAF Military base. The outdoor event and accompanying programme celebrated 20 years since the MOD returned Greenham Common to local people and the Greenham Trust was formed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GREENHAM:100 YEARS OF WAR AND PEACE</strong></p><p><strong>Written by Beth Flintoff<br />Music by Nick Bic&acirc;t&nbsp;<br />Performance Director Sophie Austin.<br />Creative Director &amp; Producer Rosa Productions<br />A large cast of local performers, choir, musicians, artists and re-enactors with Paola Dionisotti and other professional performers.</strong></p><p>For more information about this production please click on the links below.</p><p><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/outdoor-event"><strong>GREENHAM: 100 Outdoor Event</strong></a></p><p><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info"><strong>GREENHAM: 100 Programme</strong></a></p><p>The talks and events programme included</p><p><a href="https://cornexchangenew.com/event/missiles-politics-and-peace"><strong>Mis</strong><strong>siles, Politics and&nbsp;</strong><strong>showdown?</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>Corn Exchange, Newbury</strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info">Memories of Greenham Common Planes, Military, Nature, Dances, Peace</a>&nbsp; Royal British Legion, Newbury</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://cornexchangenew.com/event/the-characters-on-the-common">Characters on the Common</a>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/showsandtours/shows/date/greenham_characters">BBC Shows and Tours</a>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Corn Exchange, Newbury</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://cornexchangenew.com/event/exploring-the-history-of-the-common">Exploring the History of the Common</a>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/showsandtours/shows/date/greenham_history">BBC Shows and Tours</a>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Shaw House, Newbury</strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-years-of-war-and-peace/the-common-good-book">Book Launch &ndash; The Common Good by Penelope Stokes</a>&nbsp; West Berkshire Museum</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://cornexchangenew.com/event/decontamination-suite-tours">Decontamination Suite Tours</a>&nbsp; Greenham Business Park</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://cornexchangenew.com/event/military-history-walk">Military History Walk</a>&nbsp; Control Tower, Bury&rsquo;s Bank Road</strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info">How We Made The Show with Free Afternoon Tea</a>&nbsp; Greenham St Mary&rsquo;s Church Hall</strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info">Tracks Across the Common: Exhibition</a>&nbsp; West Berkshire Museum</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info"><strong>West Berkshire Museum: Post Event Talks</strong></a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info">Greenham: 100 Years of War and Peace</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info">Plants and Wildlife on Greenham Common</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info">Flight from Uganda: No Sense For What The Future Held</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/event-info">Living with the Americans</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.greenhamtrust.com/greenham-100-year-of-war-and-peace/press-pack"><strong>Press Pack</strong></a></p><p><img alt="" src="/uploads/versions/website-logos---x----3402-1309x---.jpg" /></p></div>
