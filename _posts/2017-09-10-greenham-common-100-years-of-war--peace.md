Around 3000 turned up last night to watch the final curtain call for Greenham: 100 Years of War and Peace. Greenham: 100 Years of War and Peace was a large scale outdoor event celebrating 20 years of the Greenham Trust. On the evenings of the 8th and 9th September 2017 the story of Greenham Common came alive through an amazing spectacle of performance, songs, light projections and live art.

BBC Radio Berkshire recorded their Breakfast show from the Common on the 8th September. You can listen back here; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05d0rxf
