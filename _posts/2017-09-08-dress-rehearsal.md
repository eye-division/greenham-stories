Final Dress Rehearsal

Yesterday evening the cast and crew completed the final dress rehearsal for the Greenham event in anticipation for the first full show.

This was the first time the team got together as a whole as a conclusion to the ongoing preparations, with both amateur and professional performers uniting through miniature dramas which culminated in a grand finale. Although the sky was grey, the rain held off right until the end, meaning the performance was able to run smoothly and any final corrections to the stage could be completed quickly.
