With BBC Radio Berkshire presenter Bill Buckley, writers and historians Penny Stokes and Jonathan Sayers, and filmmaker Les Taylor gathered in the splendid and historic setting of Shaw House, Newbury to explore the long-term history of the Common today (the 6th September, 2017).

Penny Stokes has been commissioned by Greenham Trust to write a new history of the Common, and a preview of ‘In Another Time’, a film about D-day and Greenham, by Les Taylor was screened. Jonathan talked about the Cold War period and how Greenham Common came to the attention of the rest of the world. Extracts will be broadcast on BBC Radio Berkshire.
