BBC Radio Berkshire presenter Bill Buckley presented a lively history chat show at the Corn Exchange, Newbury on the 5th September, 2017. We heard stories directly from the people who have helped shape the history of Greenham Common.

We heard from those whose lives were transformed by events on the Common, from the Second World War right through to the present day. Elements of this show will be broadcast by the BBC. Also supported by the Newbury Weekly News.
