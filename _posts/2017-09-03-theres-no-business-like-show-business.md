**‘There’s no business like show business’**

*Last minute preparations ahead of the main Greenham Common event*

After months and months of planning, the final few rehearsals are taking place ahead of the main Greenham Common event on Friday the 8th and Saturday the 9th September. The free outdoor show takes place on the Common from 6.30-9.30pm. There will be a festival feel with performances taking place across the central runway site, culminating in a grande finale show from 8.30-9.30pm.

In the lead up to the main event, which will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Greenham Trust, there will be a series of talks and discussions about memories of Greenham Common. The first high profile public debate takes place on Sunday, the 3rd September at 3.30pm at the Corn Exchange hosted by BBC Radio Berkshire presenter Andrew Peach.

A live audience and a panel of experts will explore whether the peace protests in the 1980s and 1990s made any difference to the nuclear power struggle of today. Elements of the debate will be broadcast by the BBC.
